1.Write a program in Python to find out the character in a string which is uppercase using list
comprehension.
word= "ThisBook"
newlist= [char for char in word if char.isupper()]
print(newlist)

2.  Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists containing the names of students and
their corresponding subjects. The dictionary should map the students with their respective subjects.
Let’s see how to do this using for loops and dictionary comprehension.
students = ['Smit', 'Jaya', 'Rayyan']
subject = ['CSE', 'Networking', 'Operating System']
res = {}
for key in students:
    for value in subject:
        res[key] = value
        subject.remove(value)
        break
print(res)

3. Write a program in Python using generators to reverse the string.
Input String = “Consultadd Training”
def reverse_string(my_str):
    length = len(my_str)
    for i in range(length-1, -1, -1):
        yield my_str[i]
for char in reverse_string("Consultadd Training"):
    print(char)

4. Write an example on decorators.
def div(n,d):
    if n<d:
        n,d=d,n
        return n/d
res=div(2,4)
print(res)
