1. Write a program in Python to allow the error of syntax to be handled using exception handling.
HINT: Use SyntaxError
try:
  while true print ("hello")
except:
print("invalid Syntax")

2. Write a program in Python to allow the user to open a file by using the argv module. If the
entered name is incorrect throw an exception and ask them to enter the name again. Make sure
to use read only mode.
from sys import argv
a,file_name = argv
print("name of the program is: ",a)
print("name of the file is: ",file_name)
try:
    fn=open(file_name,'r')
    fn.read()
    fn.close()
except:
    print("sorry you have print wrong file name")

3.Write a program to handle an error if the user entered a number more than four digits it should
return “The length is too short/long !!! Please provide only four digits”
n=intput("input four digit number")
if len(n)> or len(n)<4:
        raise Exception ("The length is too short/long !!! Please provide only four digits")

4. Create a login page backend to ask users to enter the username and password. Make sure to
ask for a Re-Type Password and if the password is incorrect give chance to enter it again but it
should not be more than 3 times.
username= 'Mahima'
password='star'

if input("Enter username:")==username :
    for i in range(3):
        if input("Enter Password:")==password:
            print("go to next level")
            break
        else:
            print("wrong password type again")
            pass

5. 6. Read doc.txt file using Python File handling concept and return only the even length string from
the file. Consider the content of doc.txt as given below:
Hello I am a file
Where you need to return the data string
Which is of even length
Make sure you return the content in The same link as it is present.
def check_even(s):
   if (len(s)%2)==0:
    return True
   else:
      return False

with open("doc", "r") as f:
   x = f.read()
   x = x.split("\n")
   print(x)
   for i in range(len(x)):
      z = x[i].split(" ")
      for ii in z:
         if check_even(ii):
            print(ii)
