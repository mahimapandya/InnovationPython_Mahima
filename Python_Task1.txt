#1 Create three variables in a single line and assign values to them in such a manner that each one of
#them belongs to a different data type

a = 1
b = 2.5
c = "Alex"
print (type(a) ,type(b) ,type(c))
#
#2 Create a variable of type complex and swap it with another variable of type integer#

a = 1
b = 1+2j
a , b = b , a
print ("a =" , a)
print ("b =" , b)

#3 Swap two numbers using a third variable and do the same task without using any third variable.

a = 1
b = 1+2j
a , b = b , a
print ("a =" , a)
print ("b =" , b)

4.Write a program that takes input from the user and prints it using both Python 2.x and Python 3.x
Version.
  Python 3x
  a = input("enter a value:")
  print(a)

  Python 2x
  a = raw_input("enter a value:")
  print(a)



 5.Write a program to complete the task given below:
Ask users to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 , add the two numbers and keep the sum in
another variable called z. Add 30 to z and store the output in variable result and print result as the
final output.

a = input("enter number between 1-10:")
b = input("enter number between 1-10:")
z = int (a )+ int (b)
print (z)
x = int(z) + 30
print (x)

6.Write a program to check the data type of the entered values.
HINT: Printed output should say - The data type of the input value is : int/float/string/etc

a = eval(input("enter the value a:"))
print ("The data type of the input value:" ,a)

7.Create Variables using formats such as Upper CamelCase, Lower CamelCase, SnakeCase and
UPPERCASE.
lower camel case--
mahimaPandya

UpperCamel
MahimaPandya

Snakecase
mahima_pandya

Uppercase
MAHIMAPANDYA

8.If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’
again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?

a = int(input("value of a:"))
a = float(input("value of a:"))
print(a)
Value of 'a' will b changes as t will take the last value entered.
